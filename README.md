# IL2Patch

![Banner Image](assets/sample.png)

## Overview

IL2Patch is a specialized tool designed to modify IL2CPP-based Unity Android applications. By directly patching the `libil2cpp.so` library, IL2Patch enables precise manipulation of game logic and behavior through hex pattern matching and replacement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Compatible with `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, and `x86_64` architectures.
- **Automated APK Handling:** Streamlines the process of unpacking, patching, and repacking APK files.
- **Zipalign Optimization:** Ensures optimal APK alignment for enhanced performance.
- **APK Signing:** Includes integrated APK signing for immediate installation on Android devices.
- **Detailed Debug Logging:** Provides comprehensive logs for easy troubleshooting and patch verification.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

IL2CPP (Intermediate Language to C++) is a Unity scripting backend that transforms C\# code into native machine code. This enhances performance and security, but also complicates game modification. With IL2CPP, core gameplay logic is compiled into the `libil2cpp.so` binary, necessitating direct binary-level modifications.

IL2Patch automates the entire patching process, making IL2CPP modifications faster and more reliable.

The patching process can be broken down into these key steps:

1. **Extraction:** The target APK is extracted, and the `libil2cpp.so` library is located.
2. **Modification:** Relevant hex patterns within the `libil2cpp.so` file are identified and modified according to user-defined patches.
3. **Repackaging:** The modified files are recompressed and packaged back into a new APK.
4. **Optimization:** The recompiled APK is optimized using Zipalign.
5. **Signing:** The final APK is signed with a keystore for installation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have the Android SDK installed. IL2Patch will prompt you for the location on the first run.
* Familiarize yourself with hex editing concepts.


### Setup Steps

1. **APK Placement:** Place the target APK file in the IL2Patch directory.
2. **Patch Definition:** Create a `patch.xml` file that defines the modifications you wish to apply.
3. **Execution:** Run IL2Patch. The tool will guide you through the automated patching process.
4. **Output:** Retrieve the modified APK file (either `signed.apk` or `aligned.apk`) from the output directory.

### Initial Configuration

Upon the first execution, IL2Patch will prompt you for:

* Location of the Android SDK.
* Preferred version of the Build Tools.
* Preferences for Zipalign and APK signing.

These settings are stored in `config.xml` for future sessions.

## üîë Keystore Management

### Debug Keystore

A debug keystore is included in the `keystore` folder for testing purposes:

* `debug.keystore`
* `password.txt` (contains the password: `android`)


### Production Keystore

For production releases, it is highly recommended to generate your own keystore using the following command:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android.keystore -alias android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```


## üìù Patch Format: `patch.xml`

Patches are defined in an XML format, allowing for structured and organized modifications.

### XML Structure

All patches must be enclosed within the `<Patches>` root element:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Patches>
    <!-- Patches go here -->
</Patches>
```


### Patch Definition

Each `<Patch>` element represents a single modification and requires the `arch` attribute to specify the target architecture.

```xml
<Patch arch="arm64-v8a">
    <Description>No Recoil</Description>
    <Find>1f2003d5202640b9</Find>
    <Replace>1f2003d51f2003d5</Replace>
</Patch>
```


### Example Patches

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Patches>
    <Patch arch="arm64-v8a">
        <Description>No Recoil</Description>
        <Find>1f2003d5202640b9</Find>
        <Replace>1f2003d51f2003d5</Replace>
    </Patch>
    <Patch arch="arm64-v8a">
        <Description>Rapid Fire</Description>
        <Find>00009f1a60008052</Find>
        <Replace>00009f1a20008052</Replace>
    </Patch>
    <Patch arch="arm64-v8a">
        <Description>Infinite Ammo</Description>
        <Find>1f2003d5400080d2</Find>
        <Replace>1f2003d5200080d2</Replace>
    </Patch>
</Patches>
```


### Supported Hex Formats

The `Find` and `Replace` elements support multiple hex formats:

1. **Continuous Hex String:** `600080520200001440008052`
2. **Space-Separated Hex Values:** `00 d8 21 5e 00 20 28 1e 60 00 80 52`
3. **Hex Values with `0x` Prefix:** `0x00 0xd8 0x21 0x5e 0x00 0x20 0x28 0x1e 0x60 0x00 0x80 0x52`
4. **Comma-Separated Hex Values with `0x` Prefix:** `0x00, 0xd8, 0x21, 0x5e, 0x00, 0x20, 0x28, 0x1e, 0x60, 0x00, 0x80, 0x52`
